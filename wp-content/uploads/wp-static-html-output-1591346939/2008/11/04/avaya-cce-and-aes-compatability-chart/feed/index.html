					<description><![CDATA[Sathez,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Application Enablement Services (AE Services) is a software platform that leverages the capabilities of Avaya Communication Manager. AES provides an enhanced set of Application Programming Interfaces (APIs), protocols, and web services that expose the&lt;br /&gt;functionality of Avaya Communication solutions to corporate application developers, third-party independent software vendors, and system integrators.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Typically, popular IVR products provide drivers to integrate with Avaya CM. For example, Avaya provides &quot;VESP&quot; drivers to integrate their IVR products with Avaya IC and CM. Genesys provides IVR drivers specific to the IVR Vendors. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unless you are developer using AES SDK, you will implement the required driver softwares and use the method calls exposed by them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Regards,&lt;br /&gt;Lucky]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hi,&lt;br /&gt;   what are the benefits  of AES server, and who is it Interacting with IVR whether any separate protocol is there can u plz explain me whatare  thing is happening between ACD and IVR and then how to interface AES with IVR.&lt;br /&gt;  thanks in advance&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  Regads&lt;br /&gt;  sathez]]></description>
