Thanks for replying back.

Avaya did accepted our analysis and they are looking into classification board. Answer Supervision by Call Classifier is set to yes. Business does not want to send every call to agents without detecting the actual customer. Avaya does not have CPD server as their call classification is board is capable of doing this. Lets see what they find out in their debug logging..... :)]]></description>

Shailesh,

Check whether Avaya got Call Classifier board installed and using it for call classification. You can find this information in Avaya using command &#039;display system parameters customer-options&quot; and option ‚ÄúAnswer Supervision by Call Classifier‚Äù.

If delays are caused by Genesys, use option &#039;call_timeguard_timeout&#039; in your campaign or calling list. I always find it useful to configure this option to comply with regulatory requirements.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In our configuration we have avaya t server where outbound routing points are located. There is a issue where customers are having delay to getting connected. Genesys does not have CPD server and Avaya as well. I think avaya switch is capable of detecting voice energy of customers. they avaya guys does not know where to look for AES, Comm manager, CTI links etc. Please help.]]></description>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hi Guru/Lakshmi,</p>
<p>We are implementing Genesys Outbound Solution with a Avaya G3 with a Call Classifier Card.</p>
<p>We have Genesys Framework installed and Configured. I also have the Genesys Outbound Solution installed. Our Avaya team has configured a VDN on Avaya PBX<br />We have configured the same VDN (Route Point in Genesys) in Genesys CME.<br />In IRD, I have create a simple strategy to route the calls to an agent group. Loaded the strategy on to the RP/VDN. Created 3 Sample Calling List in Genesys with Outbound number for US, UK &#038; Australia repectively. <br />For the 1st Calling list I am using ISDN Trunk as our clinet has ISDN configured for US.<br />For the 2nd and 3rd Calling List I am using R2MFC or E1\R2 as there is no ISDN trunk for the UK &#038; Australia. </p>
<p>When we start Predictive Dialing from OCM and ran the first campaign using ISDN Trunk. <br />I had succesfull calls to US outbound numbers </p>
<p>When I start Predictive Dialing from OCM and ran the other 2 campaigns using E1\R2 Trunk the campaign failed.</p>
<p>According to the Avaya tech they can see the calls failing as per PBX traces. <br />On the genesys T server logs i can see the campaigns started but the call failed with cause=A_NO_CLASSIFIER.</p>
<p>I have checked and rechecked the Genesys Outbound Configuration and looks good.</p>
<p>Just want to add we are not using the Genesys CPD Server as the CPD<br />is been taken care by the Avaya switch.</p>
<p>Now what I need to check on the Avaya side to understand the call Classifier is properly configured?</p>
<p>As per some suggestions received:<br />Make sure from the Avaya personnel that the VDN has Class of Restriction (COR) configured to allow outbound dialing. <br />You can test the same by making a call from that VDN manually.</p>
<p>Can someone throw some light on what would be the ideal configuration<br />on the Avaya PBX (COR) to allow outbound dialing. </p>
<p>Any suggestion ASAP on what else I can look for on the Avaya front will be higly appreciated. <br />Note: I am using the same VDN for ISDN or E1/R2(but one at a time).</p>
<p>Pls let me know if you need any Avaya configuration information from my side to help me out better. </p>
<p>Its real urgent.</p>
