										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>				In my previous post, I discussed about <a title="Design Patterns – Runtime Reconfiguration Pattern" href="http://www.lakshmikanth.com/design-patterns-runtime-reconfiguration-pattern/">&#8216;Runtime Reconfiguration Pattern&#8217; </a> and how it can be applied in Genesys environment.It is easy to implement &#8216;Runtime Reconfiguration Pattern&#8217; in Genesys and realize benefits for server applications. For client applications,  I recommend to use &#8216;External Configuration Store&#8217; pattern along with &#8216;Runtime Reconfiguration&#8217; to improve availability and scalability.</p>
<h3>Problem</h3>
<hr />
<h3></h3>
<p>The majority of application runtime environments include configuration information that is held in files deployed with the application, located within the application folders. In some cases it is possible to edit these files to change the behavior of the application after it has been deployed. However, in many cases, changes to the configuration require the application to be redeployed, resulting in unacceptable downtime and additional administrative overhead. For example, if you want to change log folder location for Softphone and you need to make changes in all agent desktops.</p>
<p>Local configuration files also limit the configuration to a single application, whereas in some scenarios it would be useful to share configuration settings across multiple applications. Examples include database connection strings, Phone book, Transfer directory etc and storage used by a related set of applications.</p>
<p>In addition, updates to applications and components may require changes to configuration schemas.</p>
<h3>Solution</h3>
<hr />
<p>Most of the problems can be addressed by using Configuration Server to store information. On large contact centers with 2K+ agents,  it overloads configuration server and any load on core servers should be avoided.</p>
<h3>Solution #1 : Use Configuration Server Proxy</h3>
<hr />
<p>Straightforward solution. Install Configuration Server Proxy and direct client application traffic to proxy</p>
<h3>Solution #2 : Use custom application</h3>
<hr />
<p>Use custom application to store and provide configuration data as below</p>
<figure id="attachment_5281" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-5281" style="width: 787px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://localhost/lakshmikanth/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/External-Configuration-Store.png"><img class="wp-image-5281 size-full" src="http://localhost/lakshmikanth/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/External-Configuration-Store.png" alt="External Configuration Store" width="787" height="328" srcset="http://localhost/lakshmikanth/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/External-Configuration-Store.png 787w, http://localhost/lakshmikanth/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/External-Configuration-Store-300x125.png 300w, http://localhost/lakshmikanth/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/External-Configuration-Store-768x320.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 787px) 100vw, 787px" /></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-5281" class="wp-caption-text">External Configuration Store Pattern</figcaption></figure>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My personal preference is to use custom application to store configuration data for the following reasons</p>
<ul>
<li>Flexibility to store different types of data like collections, XML document etc. Particularly useful, if you want to store phone book, personal speed dials etc.</li>
<li>Easy to store multiple versions of configuration settings. For example, user may want to use different set of transfer directory numbers for holiday period only</li>
<li>Implement business rules &#8211; Depending on user, machine, site or IP address range allows you to present different configuration settings</li>
<li>Can be used as load balancing solution. In many cases &#8211; almost in all scenarios, client applications are configured to use dedicated instance of server applications like CS Proxy or Stat Server. For example, when agent logs in,  custom application can provide CS proxy details from pool instead of dedicated instance, which increases availability and performance</li>
</ul>
<p>In my next post, I will cover another interesting pattern &#8216;Cache Aside&#8217; to improve application performance.		</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>				Currently, I am in the process of design and development of custom server application to generate contact center intraday reports on regular intervals and send it to operations team. As with any other contact center servers, this is critical for business to run their operations. I was working on Microsoft Azure for cloud based services and always want to bring cloud benefits &#8211; however small it is &#8211; to enterprise customers.</p>
<p>One of the main benefit for cloud based solution is &#8216;always on&#8217; and &#8216;Runtime Reconfiguration Pattern&#8217; is used to reduce downtime for this.</p>
<h3>Problem</h3>
<hr />
<h3></h3>
<ul>
<li>Agents can be added or removed from reporting group at any time</li>
<li>Queues can be added or removed from reporting group at any time</li>
<li>Ability to support new reporting templates</li>
<li>Ability to change report name and file format</li>
</ul>
<p>All these changes to be applied while the application is running and should not impact other application functionalities. &#8216;Runtime Reconfiguration Pattern&#8217; is the perfect solution here.</p>
<h3>Pattern overview</h3>
<hr />
<h3></h3>
<p>Typically, hosting infrastructure sends notifications for any configuration changes. Application will examine the change and apply them to relevant components. From this point onwards, application will use new configuration value in the application.</p>
<p>More details about this pattern can be found from Microsoft site <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dn589785.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a></p>
<figure style="width: 581px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img class="" src="https://i-msdn.sec.s-msft.com/dynimg/IC709510.png" alt="" width="581" height="200" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Runtime Reconfiguration Pattern</figcaption></figure>
<h3>Implementation</h3>
<hr />
<h3></h3>
<p>Runtime Reconfiguration Pattern is used heavily by Genesys to support dynamic changes. For example, any changes made by Genesys CME or Administrator are applied dynamically to relevant servers using notifications.</p>
<p>In my application, I used Genesys Platform SDK &#8211; Configuration Server to get notifications and handled changes. Here are design implementation details</p>
<ul>
<li>Store only configuration server details locally</li>
<li>On startup, connect to configuration server and retrieve details from application options</li>
<li>Subscribe for change notifications from Configuration Server</li>
<li>Application is running now</li>
<li>When application configuration is changed using CME or Genesys Administrator, Configuration Server sends notification to application</li>
<li>Changes are examined and applied to relevant modules within the application</li>
</ul>
<h3>When to use this in Genesys environment</h3>
<hr />
<h3></h3>
<p>I strongly recommend to use this pattern for server applications only as it uses single connection with configuration server. For client applications like Softphone, it is not recommended as it will use one connection for each instance, which will increase load on Configuration server and severely impacts operation when it crosses 2K connection.</p>
<p>If it is absolutely required, I suggest developing custom server application to support this. I will cover the details for this in my next post.		</p>
